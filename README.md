This is just a repository to put any simple script that I make.

# NTLM to Ldap

Simple bash script to automate running mitm6 and ntlmrelayx so it adds a user or escalates an existing one through ldap/s and performing DCSync.

# ZAP Scripts

Some scripts for ZAP

Comment collector is a simple script to collect comments from sites that are in scope, it won't recognize if a string "//" or "/*" is inside a variable so to avoid collecting too much garbage there is a limit of 500 chars per comment, change that value at your will.
